Breasts under go a lot of changes in time. Pregnancy and lactation often changes the shape of the breasts making it more loose or saggy. Deflated or droopy shapeless breasts is a confidence breaker. There are a wide range of definative surgical options from implants to lifts to regain your lost confidence. Breast Implants Breast augmentation(breast implants) is suitable for women who perceive their breasts as being too small, either because they have never had full development of breast tissue or as a result of the loss of breast tissue that sometimes occurs after pregnancy and breast-feeding. Small breasts may also be due to massive weight loss. If breast sagging accompanies small breast volume, a breast uplift operation, Mastopexy, may be required.The enlargement can be done by either using an breast implant (silicone/saline) or by Natural breast augmentation using fat. The breast augmentation(breast implant) surgery does not usually alter breast function. Since the operation does not interfere with breast tissue, the possibility of breast-feeding after pregnancy remains unaltered. It must be remembered that not all women can breast-feed successfully anyway - the important point here being that the breast will function the same after treatment as before. There may be altered nipple sensation. Additionally, breast implats does not increase or decrease the chances of developing breast cancer. Hundreds of thousands of augmentation mammoplasties(breast implants) have been performed worldwide and there has never been any demonstrated relationship between breast implants and breast cancer or any other breast disease. Breast implant surgery usually is done on a day care basis. You can go home the same day after the breast implant surgery.
